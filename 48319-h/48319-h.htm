  <p class="iQ" id="i_1">
    ITHOUT any attempt at biographical details or an appreciation, a
    few chief facts in Abraham Lincoln’s great career may be helpfully
    recalled to the minds of readers. His ancestors were Quakers in
    Berks County, Pennsylvania. His parents, born in Virginia, were
    influenced by the current of migration across the Alleghanies, and
    were carried first to Kentucky and afterward to Indiana.</p>
  <p id="i_2">
    It was in Hardin County, Kentucky, that Abraham Lincoln was born,
    February 12, 1809, the child of these humble settlers. Compared
    with the opportunities of the present-day boy, his chances seemed
    desperate indeed. His attendance at a regular school covered
    hardly more than a year. Nearly all the education which, among
    other gifts, enriched him with such a mastery of the English
    tongue he acquired painfully by himself. It was a question of
    necessities, of aiding to wrest a livelihood from a new country
    that confronted the boy, and so we find him at work, and at
    nineteen entering a larger world of practical affairs by helping
    to guide a flat-boat down the Mississippi to New Orleans. What he
    had to do was done so faithfully that his employer promoted him to
    be a clerk, and gave him charge of a store and mill at New Salem,
    Illinois.</p>
  <p id="i_3">
    The first public recognition of Lincoln’s character came in his
    election as captain of a company in the war against Black Hawk and
    his band of rebellious Indians in 1832. This was followed by his
    appointment as postmaster at New Salem, Illinois, which gave him
    better opportunities for study—opportunities so well improved that
    he was admitted to practise as a lawyer in 1836. He began his
    professional career at Springfield, Illinois. Law and politics
    were almost inseparable, and as Lincoln rose in his profession,
    and became noted for the shrewd common-sense and the dry humor of
    his speeches at public meetings, he gained more and more prominence as a leading member of the old Whig party in Illinois.</p>
  <p id="i_4">
    The next steps were natural ones—repeated elections to the
    Legislature of Illinois, and then a nomination for Congress, which
    led to his election in 1847. At Washington he made his mark
    particularly as an opponent of slavery. Then followed, in 1858,
    his selection as a candidate for the United States Senate against
    Stephen A. Douglas, which involved a series of historic debates
    over the slavery question. The popular voice was for Lincoln, but
    the Legislature elected Douglas. From this contest Lincoln emerged
    with a standing which finally brought to him the Republican
    nomination for the presidency over William H. Seward in the stormy
    days of 1860.</p>
  <p id="i_5">
    Lincoln’s great career as the sixteenth President of the United
    States, from 1861 to 1865, is not to be entered upon in this
    outline of facts. His superhuman part in preserving the Union, his
    Proclamation of Emancipation in 1863, his second election in 1864,
    and his assassination at the close of the Civil War are among our
    great historical landmarks. It was on April 15, 1865, that death
    placed him beside Washington in the Pantheon of American history.</p>
  <p id="i_6">
    These bare facts of President Lincoln’s life are set down here as
    an outline record to accompany the true story of “Lincoln and the
    Sleeping Sentinel,” which is now published in a separate book for
    the first time. Brief as this summary is, it is diffuse in
    comparison with the autobiography written by Lincoln in 1857,
    which reads:</p>
  <p id="i_7">
    “Born, February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.</p>
  <p id="i_8">
    “Education defective.</p>
  <p id="i_9">
    “Profession a lawyer.</p>
  <p id="i_10">
    “Have been a captain of volunteers in the Black Hawk War.</p>
  <p id="i_11">
    “Postmaster at a very small office; four times a member of the
    Illinois Legislature, and was a member of the lower House of
    Congress.”</p>
  <p id="i_12">
    Had Lincoln finished his autobiography in 1865 he would have
    written with the same modest reticence.</p>
  <p id="i_13">
    For four years, while Register of the Treasury, L. E. Chittenden
    was in close personal and official relations with President
    Lincoln. In his <i>Recollections</i> he has emphasized certain
    qualities which find so beautiful an expression in this story.</p>
  <p id="i_14">
    “Lincoln’s heart was as tender as ever beat in a human breast,”
    Mr. Chittenden has written. “Those who saw him standing by the
    coffins of young Ellsworth and the eloquent Baker knew how he
    loved his friends—how he sorrowed over their loss. In his
    companionship with his boys, and particularly with the younger,
    there was a most touching picture of parental affection; in his
    emotion when he lost them, a grief too sacred to be further
    exposed. ‘He could not deny a pardon or a respite to a soldier
    condemned to die for a crime which did not involve depravity if he
    were to try,’ said an old army officer. He shrank from the
    confirmation of a sentence of death in such a case as if it were a
    murder by his hand. ‘They say that I destroy all discipline and am
    cruel to the army when I will not let them shoot a soldier now and
    then,’ he said. ‘But I cannot see it. If God wanted me to see it
    he would let me know it, and until he does I shall go on pardoning
    and being cruel to the end.’ An old friend called by appointment,
    and found him with a pile of records of courts-martial before him
    for approval. ‘Go away, Swett!’ he exclaimed, with intense
    impatience. ‘To-morrow is butchering day, and I will not be
    interrupted until I have found excuses for saving the lives of
    these poor fellows!’ Many pages might be filled with authentic
    illustrations of his tenderness and mercy, for they were prominent
    in his official life. Three times I assisted in procuring their
    exercise, each to the saving of a soldier, and each time he shared
    our own delight over our success, though he knew not how his face
    shone when he felt that he had spared a human life.”</p>
  <p id="i_15">
    The main fact of the story published in this book has been told
    with varying details in many versions. It is related here as it
    has been set down by one who bore an active part. Mr. Chittenden’s
    <i>Recollections of President Lincoln and His Administration</i>
    has taken rank as one of the most valuable of the volumes of
    personal reminiscence of Abraham Lincoln in the war period. Mr.
    Chittenden’s narrative of “The Sleeping Sentinel” represents the
    truth of history.</p>

    HE truth is always and everywhere attractive. The child loves, and
    never outgrows its love, for a real true story. The story of this
    young soldier, as it was presented to me, so touchingly reveals
    some of the kindlier qualities of the President’s character that
    it seldom fails to charm those to whom it is related. I shall give
    its facts as I understood them, and I think I can guarantee their
    general accuracy.</p>
  <p id="p1_2">
    On a dark September morning in 1861, when I reached my office I
    found waiting there a party of soldiers, none of whom I personally
    knew. They were greatly excited, all speaking at the same time,
    and consequently unintelligible. One of them wore the bars of a
    captain. I said to them pleasantly: “Boys, I cannot understand
    you. Pray, let your captain say what you want and what I can do
    for you.” They complied, and the captain put me in possession of
    the following facts:</p>
  <p id="p1_3">
    They belonged to the Third Vermont Regiment, raised, with the
    exception of one company, on the eastern slope of the Green
    Mountains, and mustered into service while the battle of Bull Run
    was progressing. They were immediately sent to Washington, and
    since their arrival, during the last days of July, had been
    stationed at the Chain Bridge, some three miles above Georgetown.
    Company K, to which most of them belonged, was largely made up of
    farmer boys, many of them still in their minority.</p>
  <p id="p1_4">
    The sterile flanks of the mountains of Vermont have, to some
    extent, been abandoned for the more fertile regions of the West,
    and are now open to immigration from the more barren soils of
    Scandinavia and the Alps. Fifty years ago these Vermont mountains
    reared men who have since left their impress upon the enterprise
    of the world. The hard conditions of life in these mountains then
    required the most unbroken regularity in the continuous struggle
    for existence. To rise and retire with the sun, working through
    all the hours of daylight, sleeping through all the hours of
    night, was the universal rule. Such industry, practised from
    childhood, united to a thrift and economy no longer known in the
    republic, enabled the Vermonter to pay his taxes and train up his
    family in obedience to the laws of God and his country. Nowhere
    under the sun were charity, benevolence, mutual help, and similar
    virtues more finely developed or universally practised than among
    these hard-handed, kind-hearted mountaineers.</p>
  <p id="p1_5">
    The story which I extracted from the “boys” was, in substance,
    this: William Scott, one of these mountain boys, just of age, had
    enlisted in Company K. Accustomed to his regular sound and healthy
    sleep, not yet inured to the life of the camp, he had volunteered
    to take the place of a sick comrade who had been detailed for
    picket duty, and had passed the night as a sentinel on guard. The
    next day he was himself detailed for the same duty, and undertook
    its performance. But he found it impossible to keep awake for two
    nights in succession, and had been found by the relief sound
    asleep on his post. For this offence he had been tried by a
    court-martial, found guilty, and sentenced to be shot within
    twenty-four hours after his trial, and on the second morning after
    his offence was committed.</p>
  <p id="p1_6">
    Scott’s comrades had set about saving him in a characteristic way.
    They had called a meeting, appointed a committee, with power to
    use all the resources of the regiment in his behalf. Strangers in
    Washington, the committee had resolved to call on me for advice,
    because I was a Vermonter, and they had already marched from the
    camp to my office since daylight that morning.</p>
  <p id="p1_7">
    The captain took all the blame from Scott upon himself. Scott’s
    mother opposed his enlistment on the ground of his inexperience,
    and had only consented on the captain’s promise to look after him
    as if he were his own son. This he had wholly failed to do. He
    must have been asleep or stupid himself, he said, when he paid no
    attention to the boy’s statement that he had fallen asleep during
    the day, and feared he could not keep awake the second night on
    picket. Instead of sending some one, or going himself in Scott’s
    place, as he should, he had let him go to his death. He alone was
    guilty—“if any one ought to be shot, I am the fellow, and
    everybody at home would have the right to say so. There must be
    some way to save him, Judge!” (They all called me Judge.) “He is
    as good a boy as there is in the army, and he ain’t to blame. You
    will help us, now, won’t you?” he said, almost with tears.</p>

    The other members of the committee had a definite if not a
    practicable plan. They insisted that Scott had not been tried, and
    gave this account of the proceeding. He was asked what he had to
    say to the charge, and said he would tell them just how it all
    happened. He had never been up all night that he remembered. He
    was “all beat out” by the night before, and knew he should have a
    hard fight to keep awake; he thought of hiring one of the boys to
    go in his place, but they might think he was afraid to do his
    duty, and he decided to “chance it.” Twice he went to sleep and
    woke himself while he was marching, and then—he could not tell
    anything about it—all he knew was that he was sound asleep when
    the guard came. It was very wrong, he knew. He wanted to be a good
    soldier and do all his duty. What else did he enlist for? They
    could shoot him, and perhaps they ought to, but he could not have
    tried harder; and if he was in the same place again he could no
    more help going to sleep than he could fly.</p>
  <p id="p1_9">
    One must have been made of sterner stuff than I was not to be
    touched by the earnest manner with which these men offered to
    devote even their farms to the aid of their comrade. The captain
    and the others had no need of words to express their emotions. I
    saw that the situation was surrounded by difficulties of which
    they knew nothing. They had subscribed a sum of money to pay
    counsel, and offered to pledge their credit to any amount
    necessary to secure him a fair trial.</p>
  <p id="p1_10">
    “Put up your money,” I said. “It will be long after this when one
    of my name takes money for helping a Vermont soldier. I know facts
    which touch this case of which you know nothing. I fear that
    nothing effectual can be done for your comrade. The courts and
    lawyers can do nothing. I fear that we can do no more; but we can
    try.”</p>
  <p id="p1_11">
    I must digress here to say that the Chain Bridge across the
    Potomac was one of the positions upon which the safety of
    Washington depended. The Confederates had fortified the approach
    to it on the Virginia side, and the Federals on the hills of
    Maryland opposite. Here, for months, the opposing forces had
    confronted each other. There had been no fighting; the men, and
    even the officers, had gradually contracted an intimacy, and,
    having nothing better to do, had swapped stories and other
    property until they had come to live upon the footing of good
    neighbors rather than mortal enemies. This relation was equally
    inconsistent with the safety of Washington and the stern
    discipline of war. Its discovery had excited alarm, and immediate
    measures were taken to break it up. General W. F. Smith, better
    known as “Baldy” Smith, had been appointed colonel of the Third
    Vermont Regiment, placed in command of the post, and undertook to
    correct the irregularity.</p>
  <p id="p1_12">
    General Smith, a Vermonter by birth, a West-Pointer by education,
    was a soldier from spur to crown. Possibly he had natural
    sympathies, but they were so subordinated to the demands of his
    profession that they might as well not have existed. He regarded a
    soldier as so much valuable material, to be used with economy,
    like powder and lead, to the best advantage. The soldier was not
    worth much to him until his individuality was suppressed and
    converted into the unit of an army. He must be taught obedience;
    discipline must never be relaxed. In the demoralization which
    existed at the Chain Bridge, in his opinion, the occasional
    execution of a soldier would tend to enforce discipline, and in
    the end promote economy of life. He had issued orders declaring
    the penalty of death for military offences, among others that of a
    sentinel sleeping upon his post. His orders were made to be
    obeyed. Scott was, apparently, their first victim. It went without
    saying that any appeal in his behalf to General Smith would lead
    to nothing but loss of time.</p>

    HE more I reflected upon what I was to do, the more hopeless the
    case appeared. Thought was useless. I must act upon impulse or I
    should not act at all. “Come,” I said, “there is only one man on
    earth who can save your comrade. Fortunately, he is the best man
    on the continent. We will go to President Lincoln.”</p>
  <p id="p2_2">
    I went swiftly out of the Treasury over to the White House, and up
    the stairway to the little office where the President was writing.
    The boys followed in a procession. I did not give the thought time
    to get any hold on me that I, an officer of the government, was
    committing an impropriety in thus rushing a matter upon the
    President’s attention. The President was the first to speak.</p>
  <p id="p2_3">
    “What is this?” he asked. “An expedition to kidnap somebody, or to
    get another brigadier appointed, or for a furlough to go home to
    vote? I cannot do it, gentlemen. Brigadiers are thicker than
    drum-majors, and I couldn’t get a furlough for myself if I asked
    it from the War Department.”</p>
  <p id="p2_4">
    There was hope in the tone in which he spoke. I went straight to
    my point. “Mr. President,” I said, “these men want nothing for
    themselves. They are Green Mountain boys of the Third Vermont, who
    have come to stay as long as you need good soldiers. They don’t
    want promotion until they earn it. But they do want something that
    you alone can give them—the life of a comrade.”</p>
  <p id="p2_5">
    “What has he done?” asked the President. “You Vermonters are not a
    bad lot, generally. Has he committed murder or mutiny, or what
    other felony?”</p>
  <p id="p2_6">
    “Tell him,” I whispered to the captain.</p>
  <p id="p2_7">
    “I cannot! I cannot! I should stammer like a fool! You can do it
    better!”</p>
  <p id="p2_8">
    “Captain,” I said, pushing him forward, “Scott’s life depends on
    you. You must tell the President the story. I only know it from
    hearsay.”</p>
  <p id="p2_9">
    He commenced like the man by the Sea of Galilee, who had an
    impediment in his speech; but very soon the string of his tongue
    was loosened, and he spoke plain. He began to word-paint a picture
    with the hand of a master. As the words burst from his lips they
    stirred my own blood. He gave a graphic account of the whole
    story, and ended by saying: “He is as brave a boy as there is in
    your army, sir. Scott is no coward. Our mountains breed no
    cowards. They are the homes of thirty thousand men who voted for
    Abraham Lincoln. They will not be able to see that the best thing
    to be done with William Scott will be to shoot him like a traitor
    and bury him like a dog! Oh, Mr. Lincoln, can you?”</p>

  <p class="v6" id="p2_10">
    “No, I can’t!” exclaimed the President. It was one of the moments
    when his countenance became such a remarkable study. It had become
    very earnest as the captain rose with his subject; then it took on
    that melancholy expression which, later in his life, became so
    infinitely touching. I thought I could detect a mist in the deep
    cavities of his eyes. Then, in a flash, there was a total change.
    He smiled, and finally broke into a hearty laugh, as he asked me:</p>
  <p id="p2_11">
    “Do your Green Mountain boys fight as well as they talk? If they
    do, I don’t wonder at the legends about Ethan Allen.” Then his
    face softened as he said: “But what can I do? What do you expect
    me to do? As you know, I have not much influence with the
    departments?”</p>
  <p id="p2_12">
    “I have not thought the matter out,” I said. “I feel a deep
    interest in saving young Scott’s life. I think I knew the boy’s
    father. It is useless to apply to General Smith. An application to
    the Secretary of War would only be referred to General Smith. The
    only thing to be done was to apply to you. It seems to me that if
    you would sign an order suspending Scott’s execution until his
    friends can have his case examined, I might carry it to the War
    Department, and so insure the delivery of the order to General
    Smith to-day through the regular channels of the War Office.”</p>
  <p id="p2_13">
    “No! I do not think that course would be safe. You do not know
    these officers of the regular army. They are a law unto themselves.
    They sincerely think that it is good policy occasionally to shoot
    a soldier. I can see it, where a soldier deserts or commits a
    crime, but I cannot in such a case as Scott’s. They say that I am
    always interfering with the discipline of the army and being cruel
    to the soldiers. Well, I can’t help it, so I shall have to go
    right on doing wrong. I do not think an honest, brave soldier,
    conscious of no crime but sleeping when he was weary, ought to be
    shot or hung. The country has better uses for him.”</p>
  <p id="p2_14">
    “Captain,” continued the President, “your boy shall not be
    shot—that is, not to-morrow, nor until I know more about his
    case.” To me he said: “I will have to attend to this matter myself.
    I have for some time intended to go up to the Chain Bridge. I will
    do so to-day. I shall then know that there is no mistake in
    suspending the execution.”</p>
  <p id="p2_15">
    I remarked that he was undertaking a burden which we had no right
    to impose; that it was asking too much of the President in behalf
    of a private soldier.</p>
  <p id="p2_16">
    “Scott’s life is as valuable to him as that of any person in the
    land,” he said. “You remember the remark of a Scotchman about the
    head of a nobleman who was decapitated. ‘It was a small matter of
    a head, but it was valuable to him, poor fellow, for it was the
    only one he had.’”</p>
  <p id="p2_17">
    I saw that remonstrance was vain. I suppressed the rising
    gratitude of the soldiers, and we took our leave. Two members of
    “the committee” remained to watch events in the city, while the
    others returned to carry the news of their success to Scott and
    to the camp. Later in the day the two members reported that the
    President had started in the direction of the camp; that their
    work here was ended, and they proposed to return to their quarters.</p>

    ITHIN a day or two the newspapers reported that a soldier,
    sentenced to be shot for sleeping on his post, had been pardoned
    by the President and returned to his regiment. Other duties
    pressed me, and it was December before I heard anything further
    from Scott. Then another elderly soldier of the same company,
    whose health had failed, and who was arranging for his own
    discharge, called upon me, and I made inquiry about Scott. The
    soldier gave an enthusiastic account of him. He was in splendid
    health, was very athletic, popular with everybody, and had the
    reputation of being the best all-around soldier in the company, if
    not in the regiment. His mate was the elderly soldier who had
    visited me with the party in September, who would be able to tell
    me all about him. To him I sent a message, asking him to see me
    when he was next in the city. His name was Ellis or Evans.</p>
  <p id="p3_2">
    Not long afterward he called at my office, and, as his leave
    permitted, I kept him overnight at my house, and gathered from him
    the following facts about Scott. He said that, as we supposed, the
    President went to the camp, had a long conversation with Scott, at
    the end of which he was sent back to his company a free man. The
    President had given him a paper, which he preserved very carefully,
    which was supposed to be his discharge from the sentence. A
    regular order for his pardon had been read in the presence of the
    regiment, signed by General McClellan, but every one knew that his
    life had been saved by the President.</p>
  <p id="p3_3">
    From that day Scott was the most industrious man in the company.
    He was always at work, generally helping some other soldier. His
    arms and his dress were neat and cleanly; he took charge of
    policing the company’s quarters; was never absent at roll-call,
    unless he was sent away, and always on hand if there was any work
    to be done. He was very strong, and practised feats of strength
    until he could pick up a man lying on the ground and carry him
    away on his shoulders. He was of great use in the hospital, and in
    all the serious cases sought employment as a nurse, because it
    trained him in night-work and keeping awake at night. He soon
    attracted attention. He was offered promotion, which, for some
    reason, he declined.</p>
  <p id="p3_4">
    It was a long time before he would speak of his interview with Mr.
    Lincoln. One night, when he had received a long letter from home,
    Scott opened his heart and told Evans the story.</p>
  <p id="p3_5">
    Scott said: “The President was the kindest man I had ever seen; I
    knew him at once by a Lincoln medal I had long worn. I was scared
    at first, for I had never before talked with a great man. But Mr.
    Lincoln was so easy with me, so gentle, that I soon forgot my
    fright. He asked me all about the people at home, the neighbors,
    the farm, and where I went to school, and who my school-mates were.
    Then he asked me about mother, and how she looked, and I was glad
    I could take her photograph from my bosom and show it to him. He
    said how thankful I ought to be that my mother still lived, and
    how, if he was in my place, he would try to make her a proud
    mother, and never cause her a sorrow or a tear. I cannot remember
    it all, but every word was so kind.</p>

    “He had said nothing yet about that dreadful next morning. I
    thought it must be that he was so kind-hearted that he didn’t like
    to speak of it. But why did he say so much about my mother, and my
    not causing her a sorrow or a tear, when I knew that I must die
    the next morning? But I supposed that was something that would
    have to go unexplained, and so I determined to brace up and tell
    him that I did not feel a bit guilty, and ask him wouldn’t he fix
    it so that the firing-party would not be from our regiment! That
    was going to be the hardest of all—to die by the hands of my
    comrades. Just as I was going to ask him this favor he stood up,
    and he says to me: ‘My boy, stand up here and look me in the
    face.’ I did as he bade me. ‘My boy,’ he said, ‘you are not going
    to be shot to-morrow. I believe you when you tell me that you
    could not keep awake. I am going to trust you, and send you back
    to your regiment. But I have been put to a good deal of trouble on
    your account. I have had to come up here from Washington when I
    have got a great deal to do; and what I want to know is, how you
    are going to pay my bill?’ There was a big lump in my throat; I
    could scarcely speak. I had expected to die, you see, and had kind
    of got used to thinking that way. To have it all changed in a
    minute! But I got it crowded down, and managed to say, ‘I am
    grateful, Mr. Lincoln! I hope I am as grateful as ever a man can
    be to you for saving my life. But it comes upon me sudden and
    unexpected like. I didn’t lay out for it at all. But there is some
    way to pay you, and I will find it after a little. There is the
    bounty in the savings-bank. I guess we could borrow some money on
    the mortgage of the farm. There was my pay, which was something,
    and if he would wait until pay-day I was sure the boys would help,
    so I thought we could make it up, if it wasn’t more than five or
    six hundred dollars.’ ‘But it is a great deal more than that,’ he
    said. Then I said I didn’t just see how, but I was sure I would
    find some way—if I lived.</p>
  <p id="p3_7">
    “Then Mr. Lincoln put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my
    face as if he was sorry, and said: ‘My boy, my bill is a very
    large one. Your friends cannot pay it, nor your bounty, nor the
    farm, nor all your comrades! There is only one man in all the
    world who can pay it, and his name is William Scott! If from this
    day William Scott does his duty, so that, if I was there when he
    comes to die, he can look me in the face as he does now, and say,
    ‘I have kept my promise, and I have done my duty as a soldier,’
    then my debt will be paid. Will you make that promise and try to
    keep it?’</p>
  <p id="p3_8">
    “I said I would make the promise, and, with God’s help, I would
    keep it. I could not say any more. I wanted to tell him how hard I
    would try to do all he wanted; but the words would not come, so I
    had to let it all go unsaid. He went away, out of my sight forever.
    I know I shall never see him again; but may God forget me if I
    ever forget his kind words or my promise.”</p>
  <p id="p3_9">
    This was the end of the story of Evans, who got his discharge, and
    went home at the close of the year. I heard from Scott
    occasionally afterward. He was gaining a wonderful reputation as
    an athlete. He was the strongest man in the regiment. The regiment
    was engaged in two or three reconnoissances in force, in which he
    performed the most exposed service with singular bravery. If any
    man was in trouble, Scott was his good Samaritan; if any soldier
    was sick, Scott was his nurse. He was ready to volunteer for any
    extra service or labor—he had done some difficult and useful
    scouting. He still refused promotion, saying that he had done
    nothing worthy of it. The final result was that he was the general
    favorite of all his comrades, the most popular man in the
    regiment, and modest, unassuming, and unspoiled by his success.</p>

    HE next scene in this drama opens on the Peninsula, between the
    York and the James rivers, in March, 1862. The sluggish Warwick
    River runs from its source, near Yorktown, across the Peninsula to
    its discharge. It formed at that time a line of defence, which had
    been fortified by General Magruder, and was held by him with a
    force of some twelve thousand Confederates. Yorktown was an
    important position to the Confederates.</p>
  <p id="p4_2">
    On April 15th the division of General Smith was ordered to stop
    the enemy’s work on the intrenchments at Lee’s Mills, the
    strongest position on the Warwick River. His force consisted of
    the Vermont brigade of five regiments and three batteries of
    artillery. After a lively skirmish, which occupied the greater
    part of the forenoon, this order was executed, and should have
    ended the movement.</p>
  <p id="p4_3">
    But about noon General McClellan with his staff, including the
    French princes, came upon the scene, and ordered General Smith to
    assault and capture the rebel works on the opposite bank. Some
    discretion was given to General Smith, who was directed not to
    bring on a general engagement, but to withdraw his men if he found
    the defence too strong to be overcome. This discretion cost many
    lives when the moment came for its exercise.</p>
  <p id="p4_4">
    General Smith disposed his forces for the assault, which was made
    by Companies D, E, F, and K of the Third Vermont Regiment, covered
    by the artillery, with the Vermont brigade in reserve. About four
    o’clock in the afternoon the charge was ordered. Unclasping their
    belts and holding their guns and cartridge-boxes above their heads,
    the Vermonters dashed into and across the stream at Dam Number
    One, the strongest position in the Confederate line, and cleared
    out the rifle-pits. But the earthworks were held by an
    overwhelming force of rebels, and proved impregnable. After a
    dashing attack upon them the Vermonters were repulsed, and were
    ordered to retire across the river. They retreated under a heavy
    fire, leaving nearly half their number dead or wounded in the
    river and on the opposite shore.</p>
  <p id="p4_5">
    Every member of these four companies was a brave man. But all the
    eye-witnesses agreed that among those who in this, their first
    hard battle, faced death without blanching, there was none braver
    or more efficient than William Scott, of Company K, debtor for his
    own life to President Lincoln. He was almost the first to reach
    the south bank of the river, the first in the rifle-pits, and the
    last to retreat. He recrossed the river with a wounded officer on
    his back—he carried him to a place of safety, and returned to
    assist his comrades, who did not agree on the number of wounded
    men saved by him from drowning or capture, but all agreed that he
    had carried the last wounded man from the south bank, and was
    nearly across the stream, when the fire of the rebels was
    concentrated upon him; he staggered with his living burden to the
    shore and fell.</p>
  <p id="p4_6">
    An account of the closing scene in the life of William Scott was
    given me by a wounded comrade, as he lay upon his cot in a
    hospital tent near Columbia College, in Washington, after the
    retreat of the army from the Peninsula. “He was shot all to
    pieces,” said private H. “We carried him back, out of the line of
    fire, and laid him on the grass to die. His body was shot through
    and through, and the blood was pouring from his many wounds. But
    his strength was great, and such a powerful man was hard to kill.
    The surgeons checked the flow of blood—they said he had rallied
    from the shock; we laid him on a cot in a hospital tent, and the
    boys crowded around him, until the doctors said they must leave if
    he was to have any chance at all. We all knew he must die. We
    dropped onto the ground wherever we could, and fell into a broken
    slumber—wounded and well side by side. Just at daylight the word
    was passed that Scott wanted to see us all. We went into his tent
    and stood around his cot. His face was bright and his voice
    cheerful. ‘Boys,’ he said, ‘I shall never see another battle. I
    supposed this would be my last. I haven’t much to say. You all
    know what you can tell them at home about me. I have <i>tried</i>
    to do the right thing! I am almost certain you will all say <i>
    that</i>.’ Then while his strength was failing, his life ebbing
    away, and we looked to see his voice sink into a whisper, his face
    lighted up and his voice came out natural and clear as he said:
    ‘If any of you ever have the chance, I wish you would tell
    President Lincoln that I have never forgotten the kind words he
    said to me at the Chain Bridge; that I have tried to be a good
    soldier and true to the flag; that I should have paid my whole
    debt to him if I had lived; and that now, when I know that I am
    dying, I think of his kind face and thank him again, because he
    gave me the chance to fall like a soldier in battle, and not like
    a coward by the hands of my comrades.’</p>

    “His face, as he uttered these words, was that of a happy man. Not
    a groan or an expression of pain, not a word of complaint or
    regret, came from his lips. ‘Good-bye, boys!’ he said, cheerily.
    Then he closed his own eyes, crossed his hands on his breast,
    and—and—that was all. His face was at rest, and we all said it was
    beautiful. Strong men stood around his bed; they had seen their
    comrades fall, and had been very near to death themselves: such
    men are accustomed to control their feelings; but now they wept
    like children. One only spoke, as if to himself: ‘Thank God, I
    know now how a brave man dies!’</p>
  <p id="p4_8">
    “Scott would have been satisfied to rest in the same grave with
    his comrades,” the wounded soldier continued. “But we wanted to
    know where he lay. There was a small grove of cherry-trees just in
    the rear of the camp, with a noble oak in its centre. At the foot
    of this oak we dug his grave. There we laid him, with his empty
    rifle and accoutrements by his side. Deep into the oak we cut the
    initials, ‘W.S.,’ and under it the words, ‘A brave soldier.’ Our
    chaplain said a short prayer. We fired a volley over his grave.
    Will you carry his last message to the President?”</p>
  <p id="p4_9">
    I answered: “Yes.”</p>

    OME days passed before I again met the President. When I saw him I
    asked if he remembered William Scott.</p>
  <p id="p5_2">
    “Of Company K, Third Vermont Volunteers?” he answered. “Certainly
    I do. He was the boy that Baldy Smith wanted to shoot at the Chain
    Bridge. What about William Scott?”</p>
  <p id="p5_3">
    “He is dead. He was killed on the Peninsula,” I answered. “I have
    a message from him for you, which I have promised one of his
    comrades to deliver.”</p>
  <p id="p5_4">
    A look of tenderness swept over his face as he exclaimed: “Poor
    boy! Poor boy! And so he is dead! And he sent me a message! Well,
    I think I will not have it now. I will come and see you.”</p>
  <p id="p5_5">
    He kept his promise. Before many days he made one of his welcome
    visits to my office. He said he had come to hear Scott’s message.
    I gave it as nearly as possible in Scott’s own words. Mr. Lincoln
    had perfect control of his own countenance: when he chose, he
    could make it a blank; when he did not care to control it, his was
    the most readable of speaking human faces. He drew out from me all
    I knew about Scott and about the people among whom he lived. When
    I spoke of the intensity of their sympathies, especially in sorrow
    and trouble, as a characteristic trait of mountaineers, he
    interrupted me and said: “It is equally common on the prairies. It
    is the privilege of the poor. I know all about it from experience,
    and I hope I have my full share of it. Yes, I can sympathize with
    sorrow.”</p>
  <p id="p5_6">
    “Mr. President,” I said, “I have never ceased to reproach myself
    for thrusting Scott’s case so unceremoniously before you—for
    causing you to take so much trouble for a private soldier. But I
    gave way to an impulse—I could not endure the thought that Scott
    should be shot. He was a fellow-Vermonter, and I knew there was no
    other way to save his life.”</p>
  <p id="p5_7">
    “I advise you always to yield to such impulses,” he said. “You did
    me as great a favor as the boy. It was a new experience for me—a
    study that was interesting, though I have had more to do with
    people of his class than any other. Did you know that Scott and I
    had a long visit? I was much interested in the boy. I am truly
    sorry that he is dead, for he was a good boy—too good a boy to be
    shot for obeying nature. I am glad I interfered.”</p>
  <p id="p5_8">
    “Mr. Lincoln, I wish your treatment of this matter could be
    written into history.”</p>
  <p id="p5_9">
    “Tut! tut!” he broke in; “none of that. By-the-way, do you
    remember what Jeanie Deans said to Queen Caroline when the Duke of
    Argyle procured her an opportunity to beg for her sister’s life?”</p>
  <p id="p5_10">
    “I remember the incident well, but not the language.”</p>
  <p id="p5_11">
    “I remember both. This is the paragraph in point: ‘It is not when
    we sleep soft and wake merrily ourselves that we think on other
    people’s sufferings. Our hearts are waxed light within us then,
    and we are for righting our ain wrangs and fighting our ain
    battles. But when the hour of trouble comes to the mind or to the
    body—and when the hour of death comes, that comes to high and
    low—oh, then it isna what we hae dune for oursells, but what we
    hae dune for others, that we think on maist pleasantly. And the
    thoughts that ye hae intervened to spare the puir thing’s life
    will be sweeter in that hour, come when it may, than if a word of
    your mouth could hang the whole Porteous mob at the tail of ae
    tow.’”</p>
